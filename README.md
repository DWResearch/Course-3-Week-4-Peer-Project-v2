Course 3 Week 4 Peer Review Assignment

This peer review assignment involved downloading a zipfile from the Machine Learning Lab at UC Irvine.

The dataset is described at the following site:

Researchers studied 30 subjects conducting six activities in training and test conditions. A lot of data was generated.

Using decompressed datasets in the zipfile, I created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

*Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labelled the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
